# Homicide Solvability Modeling

This project analyzes factors associated with homicide case solvability using data from the Murder Accountability Project and U.S. Census. The goal is to identify which incident-level and demographic features are most predictive of whether a homicide is cleared.

### Key Components
- **Data Cleaning & Integration:** Merged multiple large-scale datasets (MAP, Census ACS), handled missingness, and standardized categorical fields.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created variables capturing victim/offender demographics, incident characteristics, weapon type, location traits, and neighborhood-level socioeconomics.
- **Modeling:** Trained and compared classification models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict case clearance.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed models using accuracy, ROC curves, precision/recall, and feature importance analysis.
- **Visualization:** Produced exploratory and interpretive visualizations to identify patterns across geography, demographics, and incident types.
